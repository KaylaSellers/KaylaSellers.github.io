<p>This diagram organizes ideas for a student motivation app into six clusters: Product Ideas, Social Media Engagement, Long-Term Support, Platform Type, Hurdles, and Incentives. It shows possible solutions and challenges, making it easier to plan and understand how the app could help students stay motivated.</p>

<p>
The sketches show the main ideas for my motivation app. The first screen tracks progress and goals, the second connects students with motivation buddies to study together, and the third turns staying motivated into a game with points and challenges. Each design helps students stay focused and encouraged throughout the semester.
