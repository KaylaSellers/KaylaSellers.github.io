I’m Kayla Sellers. I’m really into coding and building projects that actually do something useful. I like learning new tech and figuring out how to solve problems, even when it gets tricky. I’m working on getting better at web development and making apps that people can use. Outside of coding, I like messing around with design, staying organized, and finding ways to stay motivated while juggling school and other stuff.</p> </div> <!-- SKILLS --> <div class="skills container"> <h2>Skills</h2> <p>I’m comfortable with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I’m learning more about web development every day. I know how to use GitHub to manage projects, and I like exploring design tools like Canva and Adobe Creative Suite. Beyond coding, I’m good at problem-solving, staying organized, and figuring out how to get things done efficiently.</p> </div> <!-- PROJECTS --> <h2 style="text-align:center; margin-top:40px;">Highlighted Projects</h2> <div class="projects container"> <!-- Problem Statement --> <div class="project"> <a href="file/github.io.pdf" target="_blank"> <h3>Problem Statement</h3> <img src="images/problem.png" alt="Problem Statement"> </a> <p>Many college students struggle to stay motivated during the semester while trying to balance classes, work, and personal life. This project explores ways to help students stay on track and feel encouraged, providing a clear understanding of the challenges they face and possible solutions to improve motivation and focus.</p> </div> <!-- Affinity Diagram --> <div class="project"> <a href="file/Canva.pdf" target="_blank"> <h3>Affinity Diagram</h3> <img src="images/Screenshot 2025-10-27 142908.png" alt="Affinity Diagram"> </a> <p>This diagram organizes ideas for a student motivation app into six main clusters: Product Ideas, Social Media Engagement, Long-Term Support, Platform Type, Hurdles, and Incentives. It helps visualize possible solutions and challenges, making it easier to plan the app and understand how it could support students in staying motivated throughout the semester.</p> </div> <!-- Sketches --> <div class="project"> <a href="file/Sketches.pdf" target="_blank"> <h3>Sketches</h3> <img src="images/sketch.png" alt="Sketches"> </a> <p>These sketches show the main ideas for my motivation app. The first screen tracks progress and goals, the second connects students with “motivation buddies” to study together, and the third turns staying motivated into a game with points and challenges. Each design helps students stay focused and encouraged throughout the semester while making the experience fun and interactive.</p> </div> <!-- Resume --> <div class="project"> <a href="file/Kayla Sellers.pdf" target="_blank"> <h3>Resume (PDF)</h3> <img src="images/Kayla Sellers (1).png" alt="Resume Preview"> </a> <p>This is my updated resume highlighting my education, work experience, and skills.
